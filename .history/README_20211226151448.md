This is my first React project for my frontend course: it's a simple note app with my design: add notes, change notes, delete notes. It was made with [Material UI](https://mui.com/) and [Nano ID](https://github.com/ai/nanoid).

You can finde here:

1. work with modals;
2. work with dates (adding update date after the note is edited);
3. I've connected this app with firebase realtime database and now you can save, delete and edit notes.

In the near future I will make it possible to add note as a reminder.

For course I've deployed this app to [Netlify](https://react-note-app-fot-itc.netlify.app/), but now it can be found on [Firebase](https://shoshas-note-app.web.app/). For now this app is really very simple, I even haven't add a storage for notes, but it's in my plans.
